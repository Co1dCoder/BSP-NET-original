# BSP-NET-2D

To run the code, install Python3.6, Tensorflow 1.15, h5py and opencv-python on either Ubuntu or Windows, then run *train_with_L_overlap.sh* or *train_without_L_overlap.sh* to train the model.
The results will be written to subfolder *samples* periodically.

You can use *data/create_dataset.py* to create a toy 2D dataset.
